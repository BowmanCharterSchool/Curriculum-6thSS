Flash 8 Security prevents a javascript call from being made from a local swf file.  To work around this, we have created a collection of html files with each of the javascript functions that we need to call.  The swf does a getURL to loadthese html files into the jshtml iframe defined in the nav.html.  The htmlfile when loaded then makes the required javascript call.There needs to be a ActivatePageTrack#.html and DeactivatePagetrack#.html foreach page track.  It will be necessary to create additional files if there aremore than the current html for page tracks up to 20.
